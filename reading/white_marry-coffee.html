<h3>Coffee Life in Japan</h3>
<p>
I cannot recommend this book.
</p>
<p>
Judging from its content, the book seems to have been written by the author spending time in Japanese Cafés podering their position in society. Although sources are given, the books avoid becoming concrete at the cost of usefulness and credibility.
</p>
<p>It is proposed several times that Japanese cafés are somehow very <i>japanese</i>, but the author fails to convincingly explain exactly how - except for its cutomers and employees being of Japanese nationality and thus having been socialized in Japan. Towards the end of the book, repetitions become more numerous, culminating in a verbatim copy of an earlier paragraph from page 12 on page 152. (Assuming innocence until proven otherwise, this is probably due to bad editing rather than the author's lapse.)
</p>
<p>
The book has a few interesting stories from coffee shops around Japan, but they are short and not exceptional in any sense. They might seem so to the author, but the feeling doesn't really transpire. It wouldn't have to if the book was more of the sociological treatise it aims to be, but somehow it gets stuck halfway between becoming one and simply remaining a sort of dry memoir about someone sitting in a café.
