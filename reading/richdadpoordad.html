I'm not quite sure what to make of this book. The book has sold over 26 milion copies (source: Wikipedia) and seems to be quire
popular among people dealing with personal finances.

I, however, could not get very much out of this book. Most of the book revolves around the tautology that
investing in assets that grow in value (or even make money) is better than ivesting in liabilities that consume
money and force their owner to invest his or her time to pay for the costs. The only concrete example of investment mentioned is buying
cheap real restate during a real estate crisis and then selling it for a higher price.

Furthermore, it offers unsound advice (possibly intented to lighten up the book?). Kiyosaki advises to be around friends that
have (possibly non-public) information about possible market changes that can be used for financial gain, which is (afaik) illegal in the stock market. In markets where this isn't illegal, it is again a tautology that having secret information about the market will be profitable. Anecdotally he remarks that during real estate deals he would sign deals only under the condition that his "business partner" would later agree to the deal, where his business partner is supposedly his cat. This (supposedly) allows him to get out of any deal, should he later decide to do so. Although probably intented as a joke, this is most certainly not legal and portraits investing as sort of a fun game between persons where basically all is fair (with which I disagree).

Summary: If you already realize that investing is only worth it if you invest in things that instead of consuming money create money, you probably don't need to read this book.
