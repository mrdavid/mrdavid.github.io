<h3>Eileen Chang - Love in a fallen city (and other stories)</h3>
<p>
The stories mainly revolve around chinese women in traditional families full of hatred generated by the grievances that have resulted from arranged marriages, strict social conventions and social decline.

The book (probably) offers an interesting look into these types of families at the time, but I found almost all of the characters despicable. The stories do not go very much beyond the inner life of women whose whole world consists of their status within the familiy and how to better or keep it, which I found a bit disappointing.<br />
These women want to do one thing but can't because some relative or another has quarrel with someone involved or is simply someone that enjoys making his own relatives suffer. I found it hard to relate to these characters who are themselves tortured by awful family relations, but at the same time will not stop being the source of them. The women who suffer under their control must either succumb to their fate or be lucky and find a husband so rich (and nice) that they can escape.

I would not recommend this book unless you're either interested in Eileen Chang or Chinese families from her time. The writing was sometimes poor (translation?) and seemed disconnected. Most stories are stories of a woman being trapped in a horrendous family and then rescued by a rich husband (or transfered to a husband that is equally awful or worse than the original family) with (at least to me) a dime novel feel to them.
