Cyanotype is a photographic printing process that was discovered in 1842.
The process produces images in a fascinating hue of deep blue. Once one has
aquired the basic chemical ingredients and a few simple tools, they are quite
easily produced at home, without the need for a proper darkroom.

I really wanted to make my own photographic prints at home. Since my tiny
Tokyo apartment does not offer enough space for a darkroom, this seemed like a good way
to start.

The process is a so-called 'contact print', requiring a negative to be pressed directly
onto light sensitive paper. The negative is most easily made with a
common inkjet or laser printer, while the light sensitive medium is created by applying
a chemical solution to paper. This allows for some creative freedom in the choice of paper
and the way the chemical solution is applied, while the negative remains malleable to
digital tools.

### The basic process

I will first give a small overview of the process so you can decide whether this is something you
want to try. A list of the required tools and a more detailed explanation of each step is given below.

The basic process has these 5 steps:

* Make negative
* Prepare sensitive paper
* Expose
* Develop
* Preserve

Negatives are made by printing black ink on a transparency with a regular inkjet or
laser printer. Depending on the size of the printer you have at home, this will limit you
to prints of the size of paper you can print on.

To sensitize the paper, apply a solution of potassium ferricyanide and ferric ammonium citrate in water using a brush (see below for details). You can
use any paper that will hold the color while being strong enough to withstand soaking for half an hour and
a thorough wash in running water. I use thick water colour paper from the art store. After applying the solution,
leave to paper to dry in a dark spot.

To expose the image, place the negative on top of the sensitized paper and press the two
firmly together using a glass plate. After that, simply place the setup in bright sunlight
for about 10 minutes. Exposure times will vary with the amount of sunlight you can get, so it
is useful to have a test image with a uniform pattern that allows you to expose different parts of the paper
for a different amount of time. Using this test image, you can then judge the best exposure time for your
image. I have found however, that the sensitivity of the process is in the range of minutes rather
than seconds so that you can usually guess the right exposure time after a having
aquired some experience.

To develop the picture, simply wash out the unexposed chemical with cold running water. You should
wash the image for 10 to 20 minutes and place it in a bath of water for the rest of the
unexposed chemical to seep out. At this stage, you can add hydrogen peroxide to slightly darken the blue
color of the image. After thoroughly washing the image, leave it to dry for a few
hours.

The last step is not necessarily needed and I do not have long-time experience with preserving the
cyanotype prints, but I usually spray the image with a water-repellent spray to preserve it.

### Tools

These are the tools you need. To produce a negative:

* A printer
* Transparencies that you can print on                    

To sensitize paper:

* Potassium ferricyanide
* Ferric ammonium citrate
* Water, preferably distilled
* A brush
* A mixing bowl
* A scale
* Water color paper

To expose and develop:

* A glass plate
* A washing bowl or tray that fits your paper
* Hydrogen peroxide (optional). Household bleach is usually just hydrogen peroxide.
* A place in the sun to expose the image
* A place to hang and dry your images

And possibly to preserve:

* Preservant spray from the art store
